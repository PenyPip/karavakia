        Hydra today appears like a painting all in grey, white and blue colours over the blue colour of
        the sea, a model example of architecture and beauty.

        Hydra is situated in the center of the island, in a closed bay and is built amphitheatrically on the bedrock side creating a unique harmony between architecture and the surrounding environment.

        As soon as a visitor arrives in Hydra, he goes back in time impressed by the view of the tall and imposing mansions that dominate at the port of the town, while being surrounded by a magical sentiment. It could be the unique architecture and scenic of the island, it could also be the long lasting cultural legacy it carries, or all these together.

        The main characteristic of the island is the absence of cars or other wheeled vehicles and all transportation is been accomplished by the donkeys, a fact that makes Hydra even more picturesque.
        The island is famous for its natural beauty, the calm daylife it offers to all guests, but also for an intense cosmopolitan nightlife.
